# Cron Command for Birthday Voucher Distribution

## Laravel Scheduler Command
The birthday voucher distribution is scheduled to run daily at 01:00 AM via Laravel's scheduler.

## Server Cron Setup
Add this line to your crontab (crontab -e):

```
* * * * * cd /home/ymsuperadmin/public_html && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

## Manual Execution
To manually test the birthday voucher distribution:

```bash
cd /home/ymsuperadmin/public_html
php artisan vouchers:distribute-birthday
```

## Log File Location
Logs are automatically written to:
```
storage/logs/birthday-vouchers-distribution.log
```

## What It Does
- Checks for all active birthday vouchers (`is_birthday_voucher = true` and `is_active = true`)
- Finds all active members whose birthday (month and day) matches today
- Distributes vouchers to eligible members
- Prevents duplicate distributions on the same day
- Generates unique voucher codes and serial codes
